    <h3>About Us</h3>
    <p>Founded in April of 2018, founders Andrew, Stephan, and Ben decided to create a api to collate NYC Public transport information out of personal need and lack of availablity. This api (Named Bus It!) combines realtime information of NYC MTA bus locations and weather, as well as weather alerts accross the transit system. The system was developed using the google maps, weather underground, and (insert bus api name(s)here). For licensing information please contact the developer at (add email).</p>
