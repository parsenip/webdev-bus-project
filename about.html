    <h3>About Us</h3>
    <p>Founded in April of 2018, founders Andrew, Stephan, and Ben decided to create a site to collate NYC MTA bus information out of personal need and lack of availablity. This site (Named BusIt! NYC) combines realtime information of NYC MTA bus locations and weather, as well as weather alerts accross the transit system. The system was developed using the Google Maps, WeatherUnderground, and SIRI MTA BusTime APIs. For licensing information please contact the developer at donotsendmail at busitnyc.tld .</p>
